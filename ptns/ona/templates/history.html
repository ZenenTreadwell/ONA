            <h3>The March 1961 Formation Committee </h3>
            <p>On March 11, 1961, representatives of Ontario numismatic societies met in convention at the Second Annual Banquet of the Waterloo Coin Society to discuss matters of mutual interest. At this meeting the Waterloo Coin Society was requested to make a study of the feasibility of the formation of an association of Ontario numismatic societies. The Waterloo Coin Society agreed to perform this study and constituted a committee composed of executive members of the society. The executive felt that the committee should be expanded to include members of other Ontario societies and set about enlisting the services of a number of prominent southern Ontario numismatists.</p> 
            <p>The final membership of the Formation Committee consisted of <b>Mr. Rod R. Rekofski,</b> Chairman, <b>Mr. William English</b>, Vice Chairman, <b>Mrs. Ruth Mueller</b>, Secretary, <b>Mr. Bruce Raszmann</b>, Treasurer, and members <b>Mr. Frank Uttley</b>, <b>Mr. Walter Holmes</b>, <b>Mr. Robert C. Willey</b>, <b>Mr. Bruce Brace</b> and <b>Mrs. Joan Whitby.</b></p>
            <p>The committee then proceeded with its study soliciting information from clubs and individual numismatists throughout Ontario. With the completion of its study, the committee observed the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>That</b> there is a definite need for an association of Ontario numismatic societies; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> there is a strong desire among the clubs and numismatists for an association of Ontario numismatic societies; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> membership in an association should be restricted to societies in Ontario; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> an association through the exchange of information would assist clubs in the avoidance of conflicting dates of annual banquets and other pursuits; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> the Canadian Numismatic Association is not unfavorably disposed to the formation of an Ontario association; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> it is desirable for an association to work in harmony with the Canadian Numismatic Association and in particular avoid conflicting convention dates; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> an association in Ontario would increase interest in numismatics, which would increase interest in the Canadian Numismatic Association; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> interest in numismatics is keen enough in Ontario for an association to hold annual conventions and, in addition to the usual auction and bourse, that information be exchanged through special lectures or symposiums; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> an association would assist in the formation of new societies in Ontario and stimulate the older ones; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> an association would assist in the standardization of judging rules, display categories and auction rules; </li>
                <li><b>That</b> it is desirable for an association to have a publication but in the formative years it should be restricted to the exchange of useful information.</li>

            <h3>The October 1961 Founding Meeting</h3>
            <p>Through the hospitality of the London Numismatic Society, delegates from the various Ontario numismatic clubs, associations and societies met in conference on October 7, 1961 during the London club's annual banquet. Mr. Rod R. Rekofski, chairman of the committee, presided at the meeting. Mr. Bill Clarke, President of the London Numismatic Society, welcomed the delegates on behalf of the London club. The meeting's purpose was to study the report prepared by the committee and determine the feasibility of the formation of an Ontario-wide numismatic association. </p> 
            <p>Mr. Bill English, vice-chairman of the committee, read the committee's report as copies were distributed to the delegates for their study. The report found that there was a definite need for an Ontario organization and recommended that an association be formed a t the earliest opportunity. After an overwhelmingly positive discussion of the findings of the report, Mr. Walter Holmes moved that the meeting endorse the report and proceed with the formation of an Ontario association. The motion was seconded by Mr. Bill English and was carried unanimously.</p> 
            <p>Chairman Rekofski then called for a discussion to decide on a name for the organization. Mr. Rudy Sauro moved the motion that the organization be called "The Ontario Numismatic Association." This motion, seconded by Mr. Robert Cassidy, was carried unanimously. So it was that the O.N.A. was officially born in London on October 7, 1961.</p> 
            <p>In discussing next steps, it was decided that the organizing committee should continue to stand and that its efforts should now be re-directed to organizing a founding convention. The chairman advised the delegates that the Waterloo Coin Society was prepared to offer its facilities at its annual banquet in March 1962 for this purpose. The delegates accepted this offer and Mr. Ed. Knight then moved that the committee stay in office until the founding convention was held. The motion was seconded by Mr. Bill Jones and was carried. </p> 
            <p>Some other early organizational topics were also settled at the meeting. It was recommended that club membership in the Association be $10 per year and that individual membership be $1 per year. The delegates further recommended that, upon return to their clubs, each one should sponsor a motion for their club to join the Association.</p> 
            <p>Dr. John S. Wilkinson, President of the Canadian Numismatic Association, was a welcome guest and briefly addressed the meeting at its conclusion. He informed the gathering that he appreciated the challenges that lay ahead and wished the new organization the best of success.</p> 
            <p>By December the committee was busily engaged in framing a constitution with the objective of presenting a draft constitution at the founding convention in Kitchener in March of 1962. Recalling the many suggestions that came from Ontario clubs during its investigation stage, the committee approached a number of clubs throughout Ontario for advice and assistance in writing particular sections of the constitution. The clubs recognized the importance of the endeavor and enthusiastically contributed.</p>

            <h3>Charter Members of the O.N.A.</h3>
            <p>The committee recommended that the first one hundred people joining the Association should be considered charter members. Early response was very good, and perhaps you will recognize some of the names of the first 25 members: </p>

            <span class="image left"><img src="http://the-ona.ca/menu/ts1a.gif" alt="" /></span>
            <h3>The O.N.A.'s First Convention</h3>
            <p>The founding convention was an outstanding success with about 750 visitors from across Canada and the United States. Members of the first O.N.A. Executive were: President Rod Rekofski, First Vice-President Lloyd T. Smith, Second Vice-President Ed Knight, Secretary Ruth Mueller, Treasurer Bruce Raszmann, and Regional Directors Walter Griggs, Rudy Sauro, Peter DeGraff, and Robert Willey. </p>
            <p> The highlight, or rather the highlights of the Convention came at the banquet Saturday evening when the 230 guests were seated that represented thirty numismatic clubs from Ontario, Quebec, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and California. </p>
            <p>The Guest Speaker, Mr. Robert C. Willey, F.R.N.S. of Espanola, a true student of early Canadian coinage, spoke on the origin of early Canadian tokens and how private citizens would produce their own money to satisfy their needs. Amid laughter, he commented that even Molson's struck their own coins and tokens, while other tokens boasted such images as rum and American whiskey. They were also used as media for propaganda around the War of 1812, and many of the tokens circulating around the colonies made demands for responsible government. </p>
            <p>The ultimate event was the awarding of O.N.A. Award of Merit. The Gold Medal, Sponsored by Molson's Brewery of Canada Limited, was the first award ever to be presented in Canada in recognition of contributions made towards Canadian numismatics. The first Awards Committee Chairwoman, Mrs. Claudia Pelkey of Oakville, introduced Mr. Clare Martin, representative of Molson's Limited and instructed him to break open the seal and read the personally inscribed inscription on the medal. Mr. Martin said, "The recipient and medal recipient of the Ontario Numismatic Association for 1962 is Robert C. Willey, F.R.N.S. Espanola, Ontario. On behalf of the Ontario Numismatic Association, our congratulations, Mr. Willey, as the recipient of this award for your research in early Canadian coins and tokens." </p>

            <h3>The O.N.A. Today</h3>
            <p>O.N.A. conventions have now been held in most major Ontario cities from Windsor to Ottawa and from Sudbury to Niagara Falls. The O.N.A. continues to be an active and prosperous organization, searching out new ideas to improve the numismatic hobby for clubs and individual collectors alike. The Latin motto of the organization, Vires Acquirit Eundo translates to English As It Grows, It Gathers Strength. The accomplishments of the O.N.A. over the years since its formation prove the validity of its motto. May the O.N.A. conventions continue with the excitement and success with which they began! </p>
