        <h2>The Ontario Numismatist</h2>
        <p>The Ontario Numismatist is the official publication of the ONA. It is published 6 times a year; each issue is chock-full of educational articles, choice articles reprinted from our member club newsletters as well as useful information on local coin club activities, coin shows and auction events. This information is crucial to help with your plans to attend these special events. The Ontario Numismatist will also keep you informed about the association's annual convention including educational programs, dealer bourse participation, as well as information on our convention medal and awards banquet. The Ontario Numismatist, in short, is a numismatic life-line for all members. If you would like to see a recent issue as a sample, just ask. As an added membership benefit, an archive of our past issues is available through our website.</p>


        <h2>Additional Support For Local Coin Clubs</h2>
        <p>In addition to all of the above, member coin clubs in Ontario can take advantage of the special liability insurance the association offers through the Hugh Woods Insurance Company; essential protection for club meetings and events.</p>

        <h2>Website Access</h2>
        <p>And last but not least our website at www.the-ona.ca a perfect way to keep up with late-breaking announcements, research material and this application form.</p>
