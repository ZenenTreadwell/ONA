This repository contains the data required to run the new webpage 
for the ONA. 

### Basic Tour
Once downloaded, a basic version of this page can be run using the
command `python app.py` in the root of the repository.

Here's what each important file and folder does:
- **ingredients** is the folder where software dependencies are stored.
- **static** holds all the files for media and unchanging data.
- **views** holds the templates for each page of the website.
- **app.py** is the main project file, it defines how all the routes work.
